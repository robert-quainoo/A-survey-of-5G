# Project Overview: CSMA/CA Backoff Mechanisms Simulation

### Introduction:
In Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols, the backoff mechanism plays a crucial role in managing network contention and optimizing channel access. This project investigates the intricacies of backoff mechanisms and their impact on contention window size within CSMA/CA networks. The goal is to analyze how different backoff algorithms influence network performance, particularly in scenarios with high contention or hidden nodes.

### Project Scope:
This project simulates CSMA/CA and Hidden Node scenarios using a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** developed in **Python** on the **Google Colab platform**. The simulations explore the behavior of three distinct backoff algorithms:

- **Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB)**
- **Exponential Increase Exponential Decrease (EIED)**
- **Logarithmic Increment Backoff**

By comparing the performance of these algorithms, the project offers insights into their effectiveness, adaptability, and overall impact on network performance in different conditions.

### Objectives:
- **Analyze the role of backoff mechanisms** in managing network contention.
- **Compare BEB, EIED, and Logarithmic Increment Backoff** algorithms to determine specific use cases for each.
- **Simulate CSMA/CA scenarios**, including Hidden Node issues, to evaluate algorithm performance.
- **Provide actionable insights** on the adaptability and efficiency of each backoff mechanism in enhancing network reliability and throughput.

### Key Features:
- **Google Colab-based GUI:** Users can easily run and visualize simulations for different backoff algorithms.
- **Python Simulations:** Custom-built Python scripts allow for seamless execution of the simulations.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** In-depth performance metrics to understand the behavior of each backoff algorithm in real-world CSMA/CA networks.

### Running the Simulation:
1. **Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB):**
   - Navigate to the `CSMA-Backoff-codes` directory and run `BEB.py` to simulate the Binary Exponential Backoff algorithm.
   
2. **Exponential Increase Exponential Decrease (EIED):**
   - Execute `EIED.py` to visualize the performance of this algorithm.

3. **Logarithmic Increment Backoff:**
